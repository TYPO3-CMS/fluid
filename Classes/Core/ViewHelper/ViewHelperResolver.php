/**
 * Class ViewHelperResolver
 *
 * Class whose purpose is dedicated to resolving classes which
 * can be used as ViewHelpers and ExpressionNodes in Fluid.
 *
 * This CMS-specific version of the ViewHelperResolver works
 * almost exactly like the one from Fluid itself, with the main
 * differences being that this one supports a legacy mode flag
 * which when toggled on makes the Fluid parser behave exactly
 * like it did in the legacy CMS Fluid package.
 *
 * In addition to modifying the behavior or the parser when
 * legacy mode is requested, this ViewHelperResolver is also
 * made capable of "mixing" two different ViewHelper namespaces
 * to effectively create aliases for the Fluid core ViewHelpers
 * to be loaded in the TYPO3\CMS\ViewHelpers scope as well.
 *
 * Default ViewHelper namespaces are read TYPO3 configuration at:
 *
 * $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['fluid']['namespaces']
 *
 * Extending this array allows third party ViewHelper providers
 * to automatically add or extend namespaces which then become
 * available in every Fluid template file without having to
 * register the namespace.
 *
 * @internal This is a helper class which is not considered part of TYPO3's Public API.
